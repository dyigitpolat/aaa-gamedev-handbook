# Lighting

Lighting in AAA game development involves several important aspects that are critical to creating a realistic and immersive game environment. Here are some of the main aspects of lighting in AAA game development:

1. Shadows: Shadows are an essential aspect of lighting in games, as they help to create depth and realism in the game world. Shadows are typically created using shadow mapping techniques, where the position of the light source is used to calculate the location and size of shadows cast by objects in the scene.
2. Global Illumination: Global Illumination refers to the indirect light that bounces around the game world, contributing to the overall lighting of the environment. This can be achieved using various techniques such as lightmaps, precomputed radiance transfer, or real-time global illumination.
3. Ambient Lighting: Ambient lighting is used to set the overall mood and tone of the game world. This can be achieved by using a combination of static and dynamic lighting to create a believable environment.
4. Dynamic Lighting: Dynamic lighting refers to the ability to change the lighting in real-time based on the player's actions or the game's events. This can be used to create dramatic lighting effects, such as flickering lights or lightning strikes.
5. Light Probes: Light probes are used to capture the lighting information of a particular location in the game world. This information can then be used to light objects in the scene, providing a more accurate representation of the lighting environment.
6. Real-Time Lighting: Real-time lighting refers to the ability to calculate lighting in real-time, allowing for changes to be made on the fly. This is particularly important in games where the player has the ability to interact with the environment, as it ensures that the lighting remains consistent with the player's actions.

In conclusion, lighting is a complex and multi-faceted aspect of AAA game development, and developers must carefully consider each of these aspects when creating their game world. By doing so, they can create a believable and immersive environment that will captivate players and bring their game world to life.
